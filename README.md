    <h4>A <b>Modern</b> twist on a classic Tavern Dice Game. </h4>
    Shake of the Day is a popular bar dice game played in taverns where I grew up. 
    I wanted to bring this forward into a just-for-fun digital game and learn
    some things about the new .net Core by making an MVC site with a web API backend.<br/>
    Hope you enjoy!<br/><br/>

    Stop back every day to try and win the jackpot!
</p>

<p>
    <h4>How to play:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an account and log in.</li>
        <li>From the games menu, create a new game</li>
        <li>Click that game from the List to play.</li>
        <li>On the game detail page, click the roll button, and hold dice that match shake of the day after each roll by clicking the ones you want to hold.</li>
        <li>Try to get 5 dice to match shake of the day to win the jackpot!</li>
        <li>Winnings are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>match 3: get your dollar back</li>
            <li>match 4: get 5 bucks</li>     
            <li>match 5: win the jackpot!</li>
       </ul></li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    The game itself is 100% playable, but I would consider the following my to-do list before i considering this "ready for beta":<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Add in dice animations for rolling via matter.js</li>
        <li>Create a way to buy back in after you lose all your money</li>
        <li>Finish security on the API</li>
        <li>a TON of refactoring to not be a quick and dirty special</li>
    </ul>

    The following would be cool enhancements to do to the game:
    <ul>
        <li>Create different shake of the day game type variations (unlimited plays per day, farming, top play per day additional money, etc), each with it's own wallet and jackpot</li>
        <li>Add additional games like shutterbox</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p><b>Disclaimer:</b><br/>
    If you fork this to build a multi-million dollar once-daily bar dice company, you'll want to fix security.</p>
